# Pic Swipe

[link to substack I write eventually](tbd)

I wanted to gamify the process of deleting old photos from my camera roll. There's lots of very similar apps on the app store, but they have annoying freemium models or excessive features that I didn't want. So, I vibe coded a quick version for my personal use. Feel free to use this app however you want, just keep in mind that it is probably buggy.

### Features

Photos from your camera roll will be randomy selected. You can swipe on each photo to either keep it or delete it. Photos that are deleted are placed in the app's "Trash". You can recover a photo from the trash page by clicking on it. When you're ready to commit to deleting your photos, you can empty the trash. 

I purposely added lots of alerts before emptying the trash to ensure users (me) did not accidentally delete photos. As another layer of protection, you can still recover your images from your phone's recently deleted.

### Disclaimers

This app was designed and tested on my phone (Apple iPhone 16 IOS 18.6.2). It is designed only for photos from your phones camera roll. I run it on expo go because I didn't want to pay Apple's insane $99/year developer fee. 

I wrote this app primarily using Cursor with `claude-sonnet-4`. The code is functional, it is not great.

This app was designed to fit my needs. Feel free to fork it to make it fit yours.
